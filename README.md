# Real-Estate-Model
Developed a comprehensive and dynamic real estate financial model from the ground up, designed to evaluate the financial viability of investment opportunities. The model incorporates a wide range of critical assumptions and calculations, including Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Net Operating Income (NOI), and detailed Levered and Unlevered Cash Flow analyses. Built to be flexible and user-friendly, the model allows for scenario analysis and sensitivity testing, enabling users to assess the impact of varying market conditions and investment strategies. This project showcases my proficiency in financial modeling and my ability to translate complex real estate investment concepts into actionable, data-driven insights.
